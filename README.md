## Description

This repository contains a Student Information Portal with a separate UI/UX for parents and teachers. 

After creating an account and verifying their child's school-provided ID number, parents can view their child's classes, their grades and assignment in each class, and their most recent behavior report. 

After verifying their account with a school-provided One Time Password and setting a permanent account password, Teachers can view their students and add new assignments by class, update individual grades and assignment names, and update student behavior reports.
